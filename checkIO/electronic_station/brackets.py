# You are given an expression with numbers, brackets and operators. For this task only the brackets matter. Brackets come
# in three flavors: "{}" "()" or "[]". Brackets are used to determine scope or to restrict some expression. If a bracket i
# open, then it must be closed with a closing bracket of the same type. The scope of a bracket must not intersected by
# another bracket. In this task you should make a decision, whether to correct an expression or not based on the brackets.
# Do not worry about operators and operands.
#
# Input: An expression with different of types brackets as a string (unicode).
# Output: A verdict on the correctness of the expression in boolean (True or False).
