You are given a number (a positive integer). You should convert it to the binary format and count how many unities (1)
are in the number spelling. For example: 5 = 0b101 contains two unities, so the answer is 2.
Input: A number as a positive integer.
Output: The quantity of unities in the binary form as an integer.
