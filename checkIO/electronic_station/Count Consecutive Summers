"""
Positive integers can be expressed as sums of consecutive positive integers in various ways. For example,
42 can be expressed as such a sum in four different ways:(a) 3+4+5+6+7+8+9, (b) 9+10+11+12, (c) 13+14+15 and (d) 42.
As the last solution (d) shows, any positive integer can always be trivially expressed as a singleton sum that consists of that
integer alone.

Compute how many different ways it can be expressed as a sum of consecutive positive integers.
